## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities: 
We perform our activities in the industry of shoes and sneakers. This industry consists of a multitude of footwear manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. It is very big industry and a continuously changing environment, this is industry is characterized by monopolistic competition. It is a type of imperfect competition characterized by a large number of firms that sell similar but not identical products. So it is very important the differentiation to gain competitive advantage. Regarding the macroeconomic factors, this is a ciclical economy and strongly competitive what lowers the average prices. The degree of actual and potential competition is high so it is characterized by a moderate industry growth, the importance of pricing and supply chain management as well as private labels and specialty retailing. There are already a lot of very well known big companies existing in the industry such as Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok... We should take into account that as we are, there could be some new entrants to the industry, shoved by the increase in the global e-commerce trends as well as the ultra cheap retailers, as Primark. Considering the social aspects of this industry we could say that the mainly ones are that it is a perishable industry, due to the fact that the nature of fashion is very changeable, and the digitalization which is the most important aspect for companies within this industry. So we could say that is is very important to be able to get adapted to the new markets, as for example the omni channel shopping. Morever there are political issues, as it is very important to be able to decrease the prices, most companies outsource their production process what leads to political problems since the salaries are usually too low, together with poor working conditions. We should focus or activity in some strategic areas, as for example: create the best customer base offering, a fast,flexible and efficient product flow, stable and scalable infrastructure and achieve growth by expanding through stores, online and digital places. Talking about the challenges, we can clearly say that the biggest one is the rise of ultra-cheap retailers and online focused stores. So we must spend and make high investments in online operations.
