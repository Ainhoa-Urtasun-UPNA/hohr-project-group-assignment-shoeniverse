## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities: 

We perform our activities in the industry of shoes and sneakers. This industry consists of a multitude of footwear manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. It is very big industry and a continuously changing environment, this is industry is characterized by monopolistic competition. It is a type of imperfect competition characterized by a large number of firms that sell similar but not identical products. So it is very important the differentiation to gain competitive advantage. Regarding the macroeconomic factors, this is a ciclical economy and strongly competitive what lowers the average prices. The degree of actual and potential competition is high so it is characterized by a moderate industry growth, the importance of pricing and supply chain management as well as private labels and specialty retailing. There are already a lot of very well known big companies existing in the industry such as Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok... We should take into account that as we are, there could be some new entrants to the industry, shoved by the increase in the global e-commerce trends as well as the ultra cheap retailers, as Primark. Considering the social aspects of this industry we could say that the mainly ones are that it is a perishable industry, due to the fact that the nature of fashion is very changeable, and the digitalization which is the most important aspect for companies within this industry. So we could say that is is very important to be able to get adapted to the new markets, as for example the omni channel shopping. Morever there are political issues, as it is very important to be able to decrease the prices, most companies outsource their production process what leads to political problems since the salaries are usually too low, together with poor working conditions. We should focus or activity in some strategic areas, as for example: create the best customer base offering, a fast,flexible and efficient product flow, stable and scalable infrastructure and achieve growth by expanding through stores, online and digital places. Talking about the challenges, we can clearly say that the biggest one is the rise of ultra-cheap retailers and online focused stores. So we must spend and make high investments in online operations.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***

Firstly, we introduced the data on the matrixes, as we are a new company we do not have historical data so we need to use the data of other companies to have a reference to be to able to forecast the number of available workers in the near future for our company "ShoeUniverse". We used the information of the industry for the matrixes D and M.

We started doing the matrix D which is a diagonal matrix 3x3 with di as the number of workers in occupation i last year: ([[15,0,0],[0,20,0],[0,0,50]])
M is a square matrix 3x3 which gives the dynamic information: ([[5,2,0],[0,10,0],[5,5,45]])
Matrix b wich is a column vector of dimension 3 that shows the information at the present moment: ([[4],[0],[0]])

Finally, we used the formula a=M*D^-1*b and we get : ([[1.3333],[0],[1.3333]]) which implies that we expect to have 1 manager and 1 operator in 1 year from now.

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***

Firstly, we introduced the data on the matrixes. The first one is matrix X: [[15,1,0,0],[17,1,0,0],[14,1,0,0],[6,0,1,0],[6,0,1,0],[5,0,1,0],[23,0,0,1],[27,0,0,1],[25,0,0,1]] and then matrix Y:[[4],[6],[5],[13],[12],[13],[7],[7],[9]] and we also get the X estimated: [10,1,0,0][4,0,1,0][20,0,01]. Then for calculating the Beta and the Deltas we do:[X'X]^-1X'Y and we get [0.125][3.083333][11.958333][5.411666]. Finally we do X estimated multiplied by the Beta+Deltas matrix. We get a result matrix that rounded and expressing them as integers we get that  we need 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators. So we can see comparing to the task 3 that there is a shortage of 3 Managers, 12 engineers and 6 operators. So for achieving a solution for the big shortage we need to carry out upsizing strategies as Hiring, Increase workweek and Increase overtime.

## Task 5
* Objective: Post 1 job vacancy for each occupation to work on remote by describing the tasks and skills required. Use [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/l-Remote-jobs.html) for help.
